    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Daisy Jane Vang, and I'm a high school student with a dream of becoming a nurse practitioner. Becoming a nurse practitioner wasn't always my plan. As a child, I was interested in many different careers. In 1st through 3rd grade, I dreamed of being a marine biologist because of my love for orcas (killer whales). But there was a slight problem-I was terrified of anything that moved toward me! From 4th to 6th grade, I wanted to become a YouTuber alongside my younger sister and cousins. It seemed like a fun idea, but realistically, I knew it could be a financial challenge. By 7th grade, I started thinking more seriously about my future. I realized I wanted to help people-maybe even save lives. That led me to consider becoming a doctor. Although I wouldn't mind the hard work, the years of schooling didn't appeal to me. So, I looked into nursing. I liked the idea but wanted a bit more responsibility and knowledge than a traditional nurse. After a year of thinking and exploring my options throughout 8th grade, I made my decision: I want to become a nurse practitioner. To me, it's the perfect balance-where I can both care for others and continue learning at a higher level.</p>
        <h1>Extra Co-Curricular</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Outside of my regular high school education, I'm also passionate about music and dance. I've been playing the violin since 5th grade-back when all I knew were simple songs like "Hot Cross Buns" and "Mary Had a Little Lamb."" But with dedication and years of practice, I've grown tremendously and am now proud to be recognized as one of the top high school violinists in Fresno and Madera counties. In addition to music, dance has been a huge part of my life. I was a member of three competitive dance teams, and we consistently placed in the top three at competitions. Though I've since retired from competitive dance, I continue to perform with my school's dance team, which keeps my love for dance alive. When I'm not playing the violin or dancing, I enjoy unwinding with video games-especially Minecraft and Roblox. On Roblox, I mostly play Dress to Impress and love diving into any horror games I can find.</p>

    <h2>Music Journey</h2>
    <p>My music journey began in 3rd grade when I found out that my older cousin was playing the violin at her school. Curious, I started asking my family members about it and soon discovered that several of them had also played the violin in the past. They shared how much fun they had in their school music programs, and hearing their experiences sparked my own interest in giving it a try. Little did I know that it would spark a unknown passion.</p>
    <p>Over the years I had advanced my placement in my schools orchestra program. Making my way to the 1st voilin section in the chamber orchestra (the top orchestra class). And soon later start coaching those in my schools string orchestra.</p>

    <h2>Web+Programming</h2>
    <h1>Web and Programming Journey</h1>
    <p>I started coding in 2024, and it was a completely new and unfamiliar experience for me. At first, I felt like I was falling behind compared to my classmates. During the first semester, learning HTML wasn't too bad-I actually enjoyed it. But when we were introduced to CSS, it felt overwhelming. Styling a page the way I wanted seemed to take an eternity, and at the time, I thought CSS was the worst thing to code. However, I was completely wrong. After a few weeks of consistent practice, both my HTML and CSS skills improved significantly. I began to feel more confident and thought the second semester would be a smooth ride. But then came JavaScript. For me, JavaScript is incredibly confusing-it feels like a mental puzzle. One small mistake can break the whole website, and that pressure makes it frustrating. I've learned the basics, but I still struggle with it. That's why, to this day, I consider JavaScript my worst enemy when it comes to coding.</p>
    <p>Looking back at the beginning of the school year, I'm really proud of how far I've come on my coding journey. I went from not understanding anything to now being comfortable with both HTML and CSS. Will I ever code again after this? Yes, if I want to do something to keep me busy for a few months.</p>
    <h2>Websites I Have Coded</h2>
    <h1>Trion Supercars Website</h1>
    <p>My class and I were hired to create a fully functional website with a matching mobile app for the company Trion Supercars. We were given 2 months with our teams to create the website alongside a matching presentation so we could present them.</p>
    <h1>Smart Home Website</h1>
    <p>This was my first ever website. I love looking back and seeing how much my coding has improved since the beginning of the year. We created this after reading a short story in English about how technology advances and how it could affect daily life. And that's when my class and I were tasked to create our own website to showcase the different technologies. </p>
    <h1>Budget Calculator</h1>
    <p>My classmates and I was tasked to create a budget calculator where I was the role of project lead. However, throughout the process I was assigned developers. And I had to guide them into what I wanted in the project. I too had to be a developer and code for my classmates. So our teacher Mr. Fast had to do rotations.</p>
