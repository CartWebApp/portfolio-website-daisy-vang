    <h2>PROFILE</h2>
    <p>I am a hardworking high school individual who puts their best efforts in what I'm put in. When new things are introduced I do my best to understand and to fulfill the request. As a high school student things can be tough but the best thing I could do at that time is to step back and get back to it a few moments later.</p>
