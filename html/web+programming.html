    <h1>Web and Programming Journey</h1>
    <p>I started coding in 2024, and it was a completely new and unfamiliar experience for me. At first, I felt like I was falling behind compared to my classmates. During the first semester, learning HTML wasn't too bad-I actually enjoyed it. But when we were introduced to CSS, it felt overwhelming. Styling a page the way I wanted seemed to take an eternity, and at the time, I thought CSS was the worst thing to code. However, I was completely wrong. After a few weeks of consistent practice, both my HTML and CSS skills improved significantly. I began to feel more confident and thought the second semester would be a smooth ride. But then came JavaScript. For me, JavaScript is incredibly confusing-it feels like a mental puzzle. One small mistake can break the whole website, and that pressure makes it frustrating. I've learned the basics, but I still struggle with it. That's why, to this day, I consider JavaScript my worst enemy when it comes to coding.</p>
    <p>Looking back at the beginning of the school year, I'm really proud of how far I've come on my coding journey. I went from not understanding anything to now being comfortable with both HTML and CSS. Will I ever code again after this? Yes, if I want to do something to keep me busy for a few months.</p>

<h2>Websites I Have Coded</h2>

    <h1>Trion Supercars Website</h1>
    <p>My class and I were hired to create a fully functional website with a matching mobile app for the company Trion Supercars. We were given 2 months with our teams to create the website alongside a matching presentation so we could present them.</p>

    <h1>Smart Home Website</h1>
    <p>This was my first ever website. I love looking back and seeing how much my coding has improved since the beginning of the year. We created this after reading a short story in English about how technology advances and how it could affect daily life. And that's when my class and I were tasked to create our own website to showcase the different technologies. </p>

    <h1>Budget Calculator</h1>
    <p>My classmates and I was tasked to create a budget calculator where I was the role of project lead. However, throughout the process I was assigned developers. And I had to guide them into what I wanted in the project. I too had to be a developer and code for my classmates. So our teacher Mr. Fast had to do rotations.</p>
