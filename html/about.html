    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <br>

    <section class="heads">
        <p>My name is Daisy Jane Vang, and I'm a high school student with a dream of becoming a nurse practitioner. Becoming a nurse practitioner wasn't always my plan. As a child, I was interested in many different careers. In 1st through 3rd grade, I dreamed of being a marine biologist because of my love for orcas (killer whales). But there was a slight problem-I was terrified of anything that moved toward me! From 4th to 6th grade, I wanted to become a YouTuber alongside my younger sister and cousins. It seemed like a fun idea, but realistically, I knew it could be a financial challenge. By 7th grade, I started thinking more seriously about my future. I realized I wanted to help people-maybe even save lives. That led me to consider becoming a doctor. Although I wouldn't mind the hard work, the years of schooling didn't appeal to me. So, I looked into nursing. I liked the idea but wanted a bit more responsibility and knowledge than a traditional nurse. After a year of thinking and exploring my options throughout 8th grade, I made my decision: I want to become a nurse practitioner. To me, it's the perfect balance-where I can both care for others and continue learning at a higher level.</p>

        <h1>Extra Facts About Me</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="extrainfo">
            <p>Outside of my regular high school education, I'm also passionate about music and dance. I've been playing the violin since 5th grade-back when all I knew were simple songs like "Hot Cross Buns" and "Mary Had a Little Lamb."" But with dedication and years of practice, I've grown tremendously and am now proud to be recognized as one of the top high school violinists in Fresno and Madera counties. In addition to music, dance has been a huge part of my life. I was a member of three competitive dance teams, and we consistently placed in the top three at competitions. Though I've since retired from competitive dance, I continue to perform with my school's dance team, which keeps my love for dance alive. When I'm not playing the violin or dancing, I enjoy unwinding with video games-especially Minecraft and Roblox. On Roblox, I mostly play Dress to Impress and love diving into any horror games I can find.</p>
