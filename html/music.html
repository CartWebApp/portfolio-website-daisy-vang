    <h2>Music Journey</h2>
    <p>My music journey began in 3rd grade when I found out that my older cousin was playing the violin at her school. Curious, I started asking my family members about it and soon discovered that several of them had also played the violin in the past. They shared how much fun they had in their school music programs, and hearing their experiences sparked my own interest in giving it a try. Little did I know that it would spark a unknown passion.</p>
    <p>Over the years I had advanced my placement in my schools orchestra program. Making my way to the 1st voilin section in the chamber orchestra (the top orchestra class). And soon later start coaching those in my schools string orchestra.</p>
